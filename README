Cairo version 1.02
==================

Perl bindings to the cairo graphics library (http://www.cairographics.org).

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To avoid installing to a system directory, if you don't have root access,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    # assuming a bourne-style shell
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
    export PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';

DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  cairo (C library) >= 1.0.0

In order to build it from source, you'll also need

  ExtUtils::PkgConfig (perl module)
  ExtUtils::Depends (perl module)
